@chapter Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a single source of documentation
that those interested in using GNU APL as a programming language (and/or
programming environment) can use to get up to speed with the basics as
quickly as possible.

It was started when I wanted to learn GNU APL; I spent, in my opinion, far
too long trying to figure out idiosyncracies and specifics that may have been
left out of this or that source, but were present in the language. As an
example, when I began learning GNU APL, I had the following incomplete and
terse sources of information:

@itemize

@item
The @url{https://aplwiki.com/, APL Wiki}, which has a marked focus toward
Dyalog APL specifically.

@item
@url{https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl/intro.html, "Learning APL"}, again
focused and using Dyalog APL.

@item
Lucas Viera's @url{https://luksamuk.codes/pages/learn-apl.html, "Learn APL
Notes"}, which was useful but terse and focused on usability rather than
understanding.

@item
@url{https://microapl.com/apl_help/ch.htm, "APLX Help"}, which is for a
different (and proprietary) product.

@item
The #apl channel on Libera Chat.

@item
@url{https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/, "Code Golf" on Stack Exchange},
which isn't focused on teaching the language.

@item
@url{https://archive.org/details/apl-2-at-a-glance-brown-pakin-polivka, "APL2
at a Glance"}, a textbook that teaches IBM APL2, which is close (but not
exactly) GNU APL.

@end itemize

The hope is that this document might help someone interested in the language
learn how things work in a more cohesive way, and to make the GNU APL
language more accessible in doing so.
